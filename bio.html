        <h4>I'm Callie.<br>I like to make things.</h4>
        <p>I am a full stack developer and web designer with a wide range of career experience.  I love to write clean and efficient code that solves problems while keeping in mind both aesthetic appeal and function.  Drawing from a background that includes work in the non-profit sector, service industry, and retail world, I have expertise in accounting, inventory management, graphic design, marketing, and customer service.  These skills inform any project I work on and allow me to better comprehend a clientâ€™s needs, collaborate with others, and think broadly to find specific solutions.
        </p>
        <p>In addition to working with code, I love to create with many different textures and materials.  My pet projects are growing as much of my own food as possible in a city row home yard, screen printing and sewing, and making and sharing all kinds of food and drink.
